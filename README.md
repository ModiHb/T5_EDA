# Abstract:
From our data services here we are looking for the best solutions for the most important cases in the use of metro stations for the largest cities in the United States from the financial, health, operational and security aspects. The model we are planning to build using this data is designing a place in the most crowded station where entertaining shows can be performed. The entertaining shows can be used for advertising or for other purposes. 
The benefits of this model could include many aspects. Increase visitors' awareness of the local places near the station, such as museums, restaurants, theaters, and other tourist sites. Also provide a safe, secure and entertain environment for the station visitors. The advertising shows can increase the profitability of metro stations.
